                <p1>
                    Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) Communication For Collision Avoidance
                    Undergrad Final Year Project
                    Focuses on providing SAE Level 1 driver assistance system to the
                    driver on the road. Through V2V communication the driver gets Front
                    Collision Warning (FCW) alerts and intersection assist about other
                    vehicles crossing the junction. (Raspberry Pi & Arduino)
                    Implemented Wi-Fi based communication.
                    Used TCP for message communication between vehicles.
                    Fetched sensor data (Speed, Distance, GPS) through UART
                    interface. Designed algorithm by fusing this data together to
                    generate warning alerts.
                    Autonomous Line Following Robot
                    Line following robot is a microcontroller based robot that follows a
                    black line path on a white surface. The robot moves automatically by
                    sensing the path and making decisions when to change its direction
                    according to the path. (Arduino)
                    Soft Drink Dispensing Machine Using VHDL
                    Soft Drink Dispensing Machine is a FPGA based project implemented on
                    VHDL that can dispense from a selection of pre-filled drinks. Depending
                    on the total cash entered into the machine as well as the choice of
                    drinks selected. (FPGA)
