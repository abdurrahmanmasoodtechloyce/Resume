                    IoT Engineer Intern at Ismile Technologies (Sep 2020 - Dec 2020)
                    Role - Team Lead
                    Being a team leader i am responsible to lead the entire project. We
                    have to design a robot that will go inside the sewer pipeline to detect
                    anomalies like crack, biological objects and blockages. (Raspberry Pi)
                    Working on Robot Control System
                    Working on Custom Vision/YOLOv3 Object Detection Algorithm
                    Working on FLASK Web Application

                    Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) Communication For Collision Avoidance
                    Undergrad Final Year Project
                    Focuses on providing SAE Level 1 driver assistance system to the
                    driver on the road. Through V2V communication the driver gets Front
                    Collision Warning (FCW) alerts and intersection assist about other
                    vehicles crossing the junction. (Raspberry Pi & Arduino)
                    Implemented Wi-Fi based communication.
                    Used TCP for message communication between vehicles.
                    Fetched sensor data (Speed, Distance, GPS) through UART
                    interface. Designed algorithm by fusing this data together to
                    generate warning alerts.
                    Autonomous Line Following Robot
                    Line following robot is a microcontroller based robot that follows a
                    black line path on a white surface. The robot moves automatically by
                    sensing the path and making decisions when to change its direction
                    according to the path. (Arduino)
                    Soft Drink Dispensing Machine Using VHDL
                    Soft Drink Dispensing Machine is a FPGA based project implemented on
                    VHDL that can dispense from a selection of pre-filled drinks. Depending
                    on the total cash entered into the machine as well as the choice of
                    drinks selected. (FPGA)
